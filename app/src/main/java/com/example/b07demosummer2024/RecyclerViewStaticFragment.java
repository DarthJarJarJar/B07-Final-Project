The exterior of the box is covered in tricolor glazes, including green, yellow, white, and blue. The interior of the box and the base are covered in yellow glaze. The entire piece is adorned with fine crackle patterns. During the mid-Tang Dynasty, the tricolor glazing technique reached its peak, resulting in a wide variety of vessel forms and refined craftsmanship. The glaze colors during this period were lustrous and the coloring appeared natural. Vessels were often fully glazed both on the inside and outside, utilizing colors such as green, yellow, white, blue, and black, creating a complex and diverse palette. The production process involved applying a base layer of slip before adding various colored glazes to achieve the desired overall effect in terms of both form and decoration. The decoration techniques included carving, stamping, appliqu√©, and modeling.
